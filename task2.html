        <p>Technology is the application of knowledge for achieving practical goals in a reproducible way.
            The word technology can also mean the products resulting from such efforts, including both tangible 
            tools such as utensils or machines, and intangible ones such as software. 
                           <br>Technology plays a critical role in science, engineering, and everyday life.
            Technological advancements have led to significant changes in society. The earliest known 
            technology is the stone tool, used during prehistoric times, followed by the control of fire, which 
            contributed to the growth of the human brain and the development of language during the Ice Age. <br>

        Emerging Technologies:

            Emerging technologies are novel technologies whose development or practical applications are
             still largely unrealized. They include nanotechnology, biotechnology, robotics, 
             3D printing, blockchains, and artificial intelligence.
             <br>
             In 2005, futurist Ray Kurzweil claimed the next technological revolution would rest upon advances 
             in genetics, nanotechnology, and robotics, with robotics being the most impactful of the three 
             technologies.
             <br>Genetic engineering will allow far greater control over human biological 
             nature through a process called directed evolution. Some thinkers believe that this may shatter 
             our sense of self, and have urged for renewed public debate exploring the issue more thoroughly 
             others fear that directed evolution could lead to eugenics or extreme social inequality. 
             Nanotechnology will grant us the ability to manipulate matter "at the molecular and atomic scale",
              which could allow us to reshape ourselves and our environment in fundamental ways.</p>

Many scientists today are looking to technology to lead us towards a carbon-neutral world. 
Though renewed attention is being given to climate change today, these efforts to find a solution through technology
is not new.
<br> In 2001, green tech offered a new investment opportunity for tech investors after the crash, leading to
 a boom of investing in renewable energy start-ups including Bloom Energy, a Technology Pioneer in 2010.
<br>
In the past two decades, tech start-ups have only expanded their climate focus. Many today are focuses on initiatives far beyond clean energy to 
slow the impact of climate change.Different start-ups, including Carbon Engineering and Climeworks from this yearâ€™s
 Technology Pioneers, have started to roll out carbon capture technology.
 <br> These technologies remove CO2 from the air
  directly, enabling scientists to alleviate some of the damage from fossil fuels which have already been burned.

 <h2>Cloud Computing</h2>
 <div class="container3">
    <p>Cloud computing is the on-demand availability of computer system resources, especially data storage 
        and computing power, without direct active management by the user.Large clouds often have
        functions distributed over multiple locations, each of which is a data center. 
        Cloud computing relies on sharing of resources to achieve coherence and typically
        uses a pay-as-you-go model, which can help in reducing capital expenses but may also lead
        to unexpected operating expenses for users.
    <br>
    Cloud computing has a rich history that extends back to the 1960s, with the initial concepts of
     time-sharing becoming popularized via Remote Job Entry (RJE). The "data center" model, where users submitted 
     jobs to operators to run on mainframes, was predominantly used during this era. This was a time of exploration 
     and experimentation with ways to make large-scale computing power available to more users through time-sharing,
    optimizing the infrastructure, platform, and applications, and increasing efficiency for end users.
    <br>
    The use of the "cloud" metaphor to denote virtualized services traces back to 1994, when it was used by 
    General Magic to describe the universe of "places" that mobile agents in the Telescript environment could go.
    This metaphor is credited to David Hoffman, a General Magic communications employee, based on its long-standing
    use in networking and telecom.The expression cloud computing became more widely known in 1996 when the 
    Compaq Computer Corporation drew up a business plan for future computing and the Internet. The company's
    ambition was to supercharge sales with "cloud computing-enabled applications". 
       <br>
    The business plan foresaw that online consumer file storage would most likely be commercially successful. 
    As a result, Compaq decided to sell server hardware to internet service providers.</p>
